    <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
    <p>The best time to visit the Philippines is during the dry season, which runs from December to May. This period offers sunny weather and clear skies, making it ideal for outdoor activities like island-hopping and beach lounging. The months of December to February are especially popular, as the temperatures are cooler and more comfortable for exploring. March to May is perfect for those who love hot weather, with clear waters for diving and snorkeling. However, it’s also the peak tourist season, so expect more crowds in popular destinations like Boracay and Palawan. For a quieter experience, visiting during the shoulder months of November or June can offer fewer tourists while still enjoying pleasant weather. The rainy season, from June to October, brings occasional storms, especially in the western and eastern parts of the country. While the rain may deter some travelers, it’s also the best time for lush green landscapes and lower prices on accommodation and tours. If you're planning to attend festivals, visiting during January for the Sinulog Festival in Cebu or the Ati-Atihan Festival in Kalibo is a great choice. Ultimately, the best time to visit depends on your preferences, whether you want sunny weather, fewer crowds, or vibrant festivals.</p>
